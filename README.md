## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rescribe-cli.git
   cd rescribe-cli
   ```

2. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # Windows (Powershell)
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
   ```

3. Verify Poetry installation and environment:
   ```powershell
   # Check Poetry version
   poetry --version
   
   # See which environment Poetry is using
   poetry env info
   
   # If you have an existing .venv, you might want to remove it first
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv  # Optional: only if you want to start fresh
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   poetry install
   ```
