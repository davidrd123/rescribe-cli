## Platform Support

Currently, this application is designed for Windows only. The following features are Windows-specific:
- System tray integration
- Global hotkey capture
- Background service setup

Linux/MacOS support may be added in the future.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rescribe-cli.git
   cd rescribe-cli
   ```

2. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # Windows (Powershell)
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
   ```

3. Verify Poetry installation and environment:
   ```powershell
   # Check Poetry version
   poetry --version
   
   # See which environment Poetry is using
   poetry env info
   
   # If you have an existing .venv, you might want to remove it first
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv  # Optional: only if you want to start fresh
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Check your Poetry environment
poetry env info

# Run the application
poetry run python rescribe.py
```

### Windows Background Service Setup
To run the application in the background without a console window:

1. Right-click on your desktop â†’ New â†’ Shortcut
2. For the location, enter:
   ```
   "C:\Path\To\Your\.venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe" "C:\Path\To\Your\rescribe.py"
   ```
   Replace the paths with your actual Poetry venv location (use `poetry env info --path` to find it)
3. Name the shortcut (e.g., "Rescribe")
4. Optional: Copy the shortcut to your startup folder (`Win + R` â†’ `shell:startup`) to run at system startup

Once running:
